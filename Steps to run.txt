Setup Instructions:

1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/JogeeswaraVNS/AI_for_HR.git
   cd frontend

2. Download the Required Model Folders from Google Drive:
   - DistilBERTEmpGivenFeedback_90_10
   - EmployeeRetentionBERTBase100Samples

3. Place them in the following locations:
   - frontend/backend/Sentiment Analysis/DistilBERTEmpGivenFeedback_90_10/
   - frontend/backend/models/EmployeeRetentionBERTBase100Samples/

Running the Application:

Open two separate terminals and follow the steps below.

Terminal 1 – Start the Flask Backend:
cd frontend/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

Terminal 2 – Start the React Frontend:
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

The application will now be running with the React frontend connected to the Flask backend. Ensure the models are in the correct paths to avoid loading errors.
